# 4700 Assignment 3

ELEC4700: Modelling of Integrated Device
Monte-Carlo/Finite Difference Method

Couples the simulations from Assignment 1 and 2 by applying an electric field across the silicon semiconductor and plotting their trajectory. Calculate the electric field from the potential
with a bottleneck inserted in the silicon material. Investigated the accuracy of the simulation and suggested improvements.
